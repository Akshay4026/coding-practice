inheritance is one of main pillar of oop
Inheritance makes the program code reusable (it used to use the variable and methods again in another class)

the variables and behavior of one class is inherited to subclass or child class from super class or parent class

there are types of inheritances:
Single inheritance -  one class to another one class
Multi level inheritance - one class1 to class2 and class2 to class3
Hierarchial inheritance - class1 to class2 , class3 ,class4....
multiple inheritance(not possible in java by using simple classes for this we use interfaces)- class1 and class2 to class3 (x)
interface1 and interface2 to interface3.


IN inheritance when we declare a consturctor in parent class with arguments then we need to explicitely give the same consturctor 
in the child class as well 

"Superclass consturctor is always called first ".

so whenver a object is created the constructor of superclass is called hence if we dont explicitly mention the construtor in the childclass 
with the same arg as superclass constructor and use super key word in it (must be in first line )

if we dont want to use this super key word explicitely we can simply use a no arg constructor in the super class along with the argumented 
constructor.
