It is a high level programming language ,
Robust , secure , scalable .
It is designed platform independent means compile once run anywhere
appplication - web , desktop , enterprise apps



-Data types of java:
1. byte - 1 byte 8bits (interger values between -127 to 128)
2. short -2 bytes (integer values between -32,768 to 32,767 )
3. int - 4 bytes 
4. long - 8 bytes 
5 . float - 4 bytes (floating points numbers represented using f value ex: 2.2f)
6 . double - 8 bytes (decimal point values)

- control statements:
     Control statements in java helps to control the flow of execution of program by using conditons 
     1.conditional statements
     2.looping statements
     3.branching statements

1.conditioanal statements : these statemtns execute the block of code inside them if the condtion is true 
- if , if-else , switch , else-if

2.looping statements: these staremtns execute the blockk of code until the condtion inside is false
- for , while , do-while

3. Branching stateetns : these are the statements controls the flow of execution by jumping to different parts of code
- break , continue , return
