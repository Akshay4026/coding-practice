why do we set path ?

we do set path in the env variables for many application 
we do this to make sure the applications inside the bin are accessable through terminal irrespective of the current working directoty 

to make it simple , for example if we try to open notepad using cmd it is simple just we can open cmd a type notepad

irrespect of the directory we are in we can open notepad 

hence while we executing the java code 
we use javac - to compile 
we use java - to run the code 

question is how do we able to use them in the cmd when they are not in our PWD

This is the reason we do path setting !!!!

Yes we do path setting to make sure the applications present in the bin folder of jdk folder to perform compiling and execution
